SwiftSensorTag
==================

This project is an example of how to connect an iOS device to Texas Instruments SensorTag using Bluetooth (BLE).

The project here is explained in detail on a companion blog post at: [Interfacing TI SensorTag with iOS Devices using Swift](http://anasimtiaz.com/?p=201)

UPDATED for Swift 3.


## Updated for Swift 5 and SensorTag CC2650

This version is updated to Swift 5 to run in iOS 13.  It also uses the protocol for SensorTag CC2650.  The IR Temperature sensor does not return any readings because it has not been fitted on SensorTags produced after June 2017.
